# The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
# From the analysis , We used bar charts to visualize the data and shows that Capomulin was used to test more than 200 mice compared to other regimens
# Line scatter plots were used to visua;ize the change in size of the tumour against the timepoint over the course of treatment. This outcome shows that the Capomulin treament was very effective. 
# Scatter plots were also used to show the positive correlation between the tumoursize against the timepoint
# Various visualization methods were used to help different audience in understanding outcome of the analysis and the data presented.
